* `App` - top level App component. **Notice that the component already has state of array of notes**
  * `Notes` - component that accepts an array of notes to display and creates a list with a `Note` component for each note
    * `Note` - component that accepts a note and displays the date and 
    text of the note.
    * **Bonus, Not Required** `AddNote` - form for adding a new note.
